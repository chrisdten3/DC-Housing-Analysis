## Overview
Welcome to the DC Housing Analysis Project GitHub repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of housing trends, transportation accessibility, and food disparities across the 8 wards in Washington, D.C. We have divided our analysis into three main parts, each focusing on different aspects of the city's development.

## Part 1: Housing Price Forecasting and Analysis
In this section, we delve into the past 25 years of housing prices in the 8 DC wards. Using advanced time series analysis techniques, including decomposition and stationarity, alongside sophisticated forecasting models such as LSTM, ARIMA, and FbProphet, we aim to predict future housing sale prices and average prices in each ward. This analysis provides valuable insights into the city's real estate market dynamics.

## Part 2: Transportation Accessibility Mapping
We collect geospatial data from the 8 DC wards and map distances from residents to major transit lines, such as metro and bus stops. By leveraging ArcGIS mapping technology, we create interactive visualizations to track transportation accessibility in the area. This mapping analysis helps us understand how residents' proximity to transit lines impacts their mobility and overall connectivity within the city.

## Part 3: Food Disparities and Accessibility Analysis
In this section, we focus on analyzing food deserts and disparities across the 8 DC wards. We explore which wards excel in providing for their residents and investigate potential correlations between salary levels and food availability. Utilizing tools like Tableau and Python libraries such as Matplotlib and seaborn (sns), we visualize and interpret the data to gain insights into the city's food landscape.

## Objectives
Our primary objectives include:
- Creating a gentrification metric to track changes in gentrification levels across DC wards over time.
- Identifying specific policy implementations that might have impacted gentrification in specific wards.
- Utilizing models like K Nearest Neighbors to cluster wards based on their gentrification status and patterns.
- Developing a website, possibly using Flask, to document and present our findings to the public.
